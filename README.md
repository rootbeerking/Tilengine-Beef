# Tilengine-Beef
**Tilengine-Beef** is an unfinished(broken) Beef wrapper library for **Tilengine 2.7.0** 2D graphics engine. There are a few things I can't figure out how to get working right, so if anyone could take a look and help me out that would be much appreciated.

## Things that are broken and I have no idea how to fix:
- Fixed point helper in src\Tilengine.bf (Line 18-24)
- Callbacks in src\Tilengine.bf (Line 27-31, I'm not sure I implemented these correctly, they could be working, they could be broken, I'm not 100% sure at the moment)
- src\Enums\Input.bf (Line 20-32)

## TODO:
- Figure out how to finish this wrapper.
- Rewrite examples to Beef


# Quick Start *(using Beef IDE)*
1. **Download** Tilengine-beef and copy it here: **C:\Program Files\BeefLang\BeefLibs**
2. Right-click on your workspace and select **Add from Installed** and choose Tilengine
3. **Make** Tilengine **as a dependency** of your project 
4. Write some code
