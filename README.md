# Tilengine-Beef
**Tilengine-Beef** is an unfinished Beef wrapper library for **Tilengine 2.7.0** 2D graphics engine. There are a few things I can't figure out how to get working right, so if anyone could take a look and help me out that would be much apperciated.

## TODO:
- Figure out how to finish this wrapper.
- Rewrite examples to Beef


# Quick Start *(using Beef IDE)*
1. **Download** Tilengine-beef and copy it here: **C:\Program Files\BeefLang\BeefLibs**
2. Right-click on your workspace and select **Add from Installed** and choose Tilengine
3. **Make** Tilengine **as a dependency** of your project 
4. Write some code
