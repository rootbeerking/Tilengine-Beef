# Tilengine-Beef
**Tilengine-Beef** is an unfinished Beef wrapper library for **Tilengine 2.7.0** 2D graphics engine. There are a few things I can't figure out how to get working right, so if anyone could take a look and help me out that would be much apperciated.

## Things that are broken and I have no idea how to fix:
- Fixed point helper in src\Tilengine.bf (Line 18-24)
- Callbacks in src\Tilengine.bf (Line 27-30)
- src\Enums\Input.bf (Line 20-31)
- src\Types\Color.bf (Not sure if this file is even needed to be honest.)
- src\Types\TLN_Bitmap.bf
- src\Types\TLN_Engine.bf
- src\Types\TLN_ObjectList.bf
- src\Types\TLN_Palette.bf
- src\Types\TLN_Sequence.bf
- src\Types\TLN_SequencePack.bf
- src\Types\TLN_Spriteset.bf
- src\Types\TLN_Tile.bf
- src\Types\TLN_Tileset.bf
- src\Types\TLN_Tilemap.bf

## TODO:
- Figure out how to finish this wrapper.
- Rewrite examples to Beef
